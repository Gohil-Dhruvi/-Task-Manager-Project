Project Title : Task Manager Project Objective :​​The objective of this project is to develop a Task Management System that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of tasks. The project will also incorporate a priority-based filter feature to help users organize and manage their tasks efficiently.

Project Requirements :​1. HTML Structure (5 points) :​- Create an HTML file with a clean and organized structure for the task management system. - Include an input form to add new tasks and a dynamic list to display existing tasks.​- Fields for each task should include title, description, due date, and priority(low,medium,high).

2. Adding Tasks (5 points) :​​- Implement a function (`addTask`) to collect information from users when adding a new task. - Validate that the task title and due date are provided before adding a task.​- Format the task data and add it to the task list dynamically.

3. Displaying Tasks (5 points) :​- Create a function (`displayTasks`) to display tasks on the page dynamically. - Display each task with its title, description, due date, and priority.

4. Local Storage (10 points) :​- Utilize local storage to persist task data even when the page is refreshed.- Implement functions to load task data from local storage on page load and save data when tasks are added or modified.

5. Editing Tasks (5 points) :​​- Develop a function (`editTask`) to allow users to edit existing tasks. - Identify a unique identifier for each task to ensure accurate editing.

6. Deleting Tasks (5 points) :​- Implement a function (`deleteTask`) to allow users to remove tasks from the list. - Update the page dynamically when a task is deleted.

7. Priority-based filter (10 points) :​- Add a filter feature based on task priority, allowing users to view tasks - searching feature

8. User Interaction (5 points) :​- Ensure that input fields are cleared after successfully adding or editing a task. - Implement a user-friendly and intuitive interface for managing tasks. -->
